The Mid-Atlantic Road Racing Series (MARRS) held its fifth regional SCCA Club Racing event of the 2011 season on Saturday July 9th and Sunday July 10th at Summit Point Raceway in West Virginia.
<p>
All three Cahall brothers were in attendance as they were the previous weekend at the 
<a href="/racing/2011/Nelson-Ledges-National/">Nelson Ledges National</a> race.
The Friday practice sessions went off without incident and everyone was prepared for the race.  Ted qualified 8th in the Saturday morning qualifying laps.  In the afternoon, he then went on to finish in 7th place in an accident shortened race for his best qualifying race finish ever in the MARRS series.
</p><p>
On Sunday, for the feature race, Ted was still qualified 8th.  He started for the first time next to one of the best Meathead drivers, Tim Jacobs.  The race start was exciting and Ted was ahead of Tim though turn 5.  By Turn 6B Ted and Tim were side-by-side 
(<a onClick="renderPopup('popupContact');return false"><strong>click to see video</strong></a>)
until Ted missed the shift and went from 2nd gear to 5th.  Unfortunately this let two cars slip past Ted and that remained for the rest of the race.  One of those drivers spun out and crashed into the tire wall which ended the race.  Another racer, Nick Bruni, was DQ'ed due to some contact in turn 1.  So Ted officially finished the race in 8th position.  His best MARRS finish in his life.  Oddly enough, both of the drivers that slipped by when Ted missed his shift either did not finish the race, or finished but were disqualified. It might not have been the prettiest way to finish 8th, but it somewhat made up for <a href="/racing/2011/MARRS-1/">running out of gas in MARRS 1</a>.  Sometimes the fickle finger of fate works in your favor - sometimes not.
</p><p>
Larry and Bob both finished both the qualifying and feature races with Larry finishing 22nd, 26th and Bob finishing 24th and 28th.
