The Mid-Atlantic Road Racing Series (MARRS) held its sixth regional SCCA Club Racing event of the 2011 season on Saturday August 20th and Sunday August 21st at New Jersey Motorsports Park (NJMP).
<p>
Larry and Ted Cahall attended the "away" race at NJMP while brother Bob was busy coaching HS football. There were over 40 racers in each of the SM and SSM classes. The Friday session were valuable as Ted re-acclimated himself to the track and Larry learned it for the first time. Ted was able to drop his times back down into the 1:38's which was respectable but not as fast as he had done at the <a href="/racing/2011/NJMP-National/">NJMP National</a> earlier this year.
</p><p>

On Saturday Ted qualified 9th with two laps in the 1:37.5 range - just a 10th of a second slower than his best in the NJMP National. He then finished 11th in the qualifying race after a bump-and-run by Danyel Torres in the octopus on the last lap sent him into a tank slapper.  He was not able to catch Danyel and was less than a true sportsman in his hot pursuit (Ted apologized to Danyel for his conduct after the race).  More unfortunately Ted then had a collision with teammate Nick Bruni exiting the octopus causing Nick to not finish the race - with only one turn and less than a quarter lap to go.
</p><p>
The Sunday race was even more action packed.  One of the racers jumped the start and went past Ted on the inside.  The start was terrible and many of the outside lane racers advanced their positions. Heading up to turn 4, #94 squeezed Ted off the track and cost him his driver side mirror and much needed momentum. Later, the same driver pushed Mike Collins off the track and even later Sebastian Landy.  The driver was DQ'ed from the race but unfortunately knocked Mike back from where he should have finished.
</p><p>
On the last lap of the Sunday feature race, where Ted had showed poor judgement with Danyel Torres the day before, Ted allowed fellow teammate Neil O'Rourke to pass him on the inside.  In retrospect, Ted realized he should have drag raced Neil to the finish line since it was again - the last lap. Karma can be tough.

Ted raced his new 2006 MX-5 Cup Car in the STU class on Saturday and Sunday and ended up with a win after the faster BMW broke down.  Small classes make for better finishing positions!
