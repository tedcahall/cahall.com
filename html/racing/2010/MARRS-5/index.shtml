<h1>2010 MARRS 5</h1>
<div class="content">
The Mid-Atlantic Road Racing Series (MARRS) held its fifth regional SCCA Club Racing event of the year on Saturday June 26th and Sunday June 27th at Summit Point Raceway in West Virginia.  On the Friday practice session, Ted set a <a href="/racing/Personal-Best-Lap-Times/">personal best</a> for the Summit Point Main track with a <a href="/racing/Personal-Best-Lap-Times/Summit-Point-Main-June-25-2010/">1:30.361 (video)</a>. His brakes gave out in the final practice session and braided brake lines were installed.
<p>
On Saturday morning, he flat-spotted all four tires during the qualifier laps after hitting a 1:30.6.  New tires and an upgraded braking system made it difficult to pull it all together for the qualifying race and Ted had a very poor performance with a fastest lap of 1:31.2 after dropping several spots from his 15th position start. His morning qualifier laps gridded him 18th for Sunday's race.

<p>
In the Sunday race, <a href="/racing/2010/MARRS-5/race-start/">Ted had a good start (video)</a> and raced fairly well.  He had three laps under 1:31.0 with a <a href="/racing/2010/MARRS-5/fastest-lap/">fastest lap of 1:30.700 (video w/ tac & speedo!)</a>.  He <a href="/racing/2010/MARRS-5/off-in-turn-3/">went off the track briefly in turn 3 (video)</a> but made a nice recovery. In the final lap he had a <a href="/racing/2010/MARRS-5/evil-ralph-dommes/">slight altercation with Ralph Dommes in turn 1 (video)</a> and dropped two positions for a 17th place finish.
