<h1>2010 MARRS 4</h1>
<div class="content">
The Mid-Atlantic Road Racing Series (MARRS) held its fourth regional SCCA Club Racing event of the year on Saturday June 5th and Sunday June 6th at Summit Point Raceway in West Virginia.  On the Thursday practice session, Ted set a <a href="/racing/Personal-Best-Lap-Times/">personal best</a> for the Summit Point Main track with a 1:30.996.
<a href="http://www.facebook.com/album.php?aid=177374&id=662089592&l=c65d021d4a">Photos from the weekend</a> are available thanks to Karen Dildei.
<p>Larry Cahall had his first interaction with an inanimate object after hooking his rear tire in turn 2 and smooching the tire wall.  The car got the frame straightened and was back at the Saturday qualifying sessions.
<p>Saturday's qualifying laps were slightly slow due to the track conditions from rain the night before.  The SM group had rain most of the qualifying race and a few of the leaders went off the track and called it a day.  The Sunday race grid was set by the qualifying laps and not the qualifying race due to the rain slowing the times considerably.
<p>In the Sunday race, Ted set two laps sub-1:31 with a new personal best of 1:30.571. Fourteen of the 20 laps were under 1:32 and five of the 20 laps were at 1:31.0 or faster.  
<p><a href="/racing/Larry-Cahall/">Larry Cahall</a> ran a 1:36 and was granted his SCCA Club Racing Regional License!
