The Mid-Atlantic Road Racing Series (MARRS) held its seventh regional SCCA Club Racing event of the year on Saturday August 7th and Sunday August 8th at Summit Point Raceway in West Virginia. It was a huge weekend for both Ted and Larry Cahall as they both set personal best lap times. Ted also accomplished his 2010 racing goal of a lap faster than 1:29.9 - and then crushed it repeatedly!

<p>
The weekend started with a Friday practice session where the cars were warmed up and a number of the <a href="http://www.meatheadracing.com/drivers.html">Meathead Racing drivers</a> got to see each other since the last Summit Point MARRS event in June. Ted turned some fast 1:30's with a 1:30.160 as his best for the day.

The Saturday morning qualifying session was amazing as Ted hit a 1:29.9 on his second lap with a small bump draft from <a href="http://www.meatheadracing.com/drivers.html#al">Bad Al Bell</a>. More amazing, Ted followed that lap with a 1:29.418 and 4 of the 9 laps under 1:30.0. The Saturday afternoon Qualifying Race was a bit less dramatic with only one lap under 1:30.0 at 1:29.749. Most of the cars ran a bit slower in the higher temperatures and humidity. Ted finished 13th in a field of 31 cars.
<p>The Sunday race was very competitive and <a href="/racing/Personal-Best-Lap-Times/Summit-Point-Main-August-8-2010/">Ted was able to run a <strong>1:29.097</strong> (see video)</a> and came in 11th place out of a field of 32 cars. 7 of Ted's 18 laps were below 1:30.0. It was a great day and Larry Cahall also ran his lifetime fastest lap of 1:35.0.  Ted upgraded to an HD video system - so enjoy the video below and the one linked above of his fastest lap!
