<h1>2010 SCCA Drivers School</h1>
<div class="content">
On Friday March 19 through Sunday March 21, Ted Cahall and his brother Larry participated in the Washington DC 
Region 2010 SCCA Drivers School.  It was actually a double school that allowed new drivers to get their Novice Permit
signed off and begin racing in regional SCCA races. Larry and Ted each lost a transmission and Larry blew out a differential for good measure.  As Mike Collins says, "Miata's are like Doritos, you keep crunching them and we
will make more"...
<p>
For Ted it was a chance to practice and see what it was like to pass a lot of cars instead of being on the
other end of that equation (as he was most of his rookie season).  We did have two racers end up on the roof of
their car and not finish the training.  I am sure they will find another school and be out on the track this summer.
<p>As always, a huge thank you goes out to <a href="http://meatheadracing.com/drivers.html#mike">Mike Collins</a>
and <a href="http://www.meatheadracing.com/">Meathead Racing</a> for their pit
crew services!
