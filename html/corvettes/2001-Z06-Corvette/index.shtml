<h1>Ted Cahall's 2001 Z06 Corvette</h1>
<p>
Ted bought his first <b> Z06</b> Corvette in May of 2001 (it was his second Corvette
- but first Z06).&nbsp; He had to pay $7.500 over
the list price for the car as it was the first year for the Z06 which had a much
stronger engine and better suspension.
</p>
<p>He still owns his 2001 C5 Z06 Corvette and
added a newer <a href="/corvettes/2006-Z06-Corvette/">C6 Z06 Corvette in 2006</a>.  
He used to drive the 2001 
C5 Z06 Corvette</a> as often as possible at the SCCA
and the Northern Virginia Corvette Club high performance instruction events.&nbsp;
You can read some of his background and history with the SCCA and racing in the <a href="http://wordpress.tedcahall.com/about-ted-cahall/">about</a>
section of his <a href="http://wordpress.tedcahall.com/">racing blog</a>.&nbsp;
In 2005, he took his 2001
C5 Z06 Corvette</a> to Infineon Raceway and did a 13.08 second quarter mile at 110MPH.&nbsp; Occasionally he
<a href="http://cahallracing.com/">blogs</a> about his racing excursions.&nbsp;
He was preparing his 2001 C5 Z06 Corvette for the <a href="/racing/"> 2009 SCCA
season</a>.&nbsp;However, he decided not to add the roll-cage and other
modifications to it and opted to race Spec
Miatas</a> instead.&nbsp; Some pictures and links of his <a href="/racing/2008/">various
2008 racing excursions</a> can be found <a href="/racing/2008/">here</a>.<p>Below
is one of the photos he took of his 2001 Z06 Corvette within the first few days of
its arrival.&nbsp;
