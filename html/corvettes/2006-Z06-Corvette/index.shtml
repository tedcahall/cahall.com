<h1>Ted Cahall's 2006 Z06 Corvette</h1>
<p>
In 2006, Ted bought his third Corvette and second Z06 model.&nbsp; The 2006 C6
model is incredibly fast (0-60 in about 3.7 seconds) and has an amazing
505HP.&nbsp; He does not plan to drive the 2006
C6 Z06 Corvette on the track as he is trying to spare it any road rash
while keeping the miles down on this car.
Currently only the Spec Miatas are driven on the track.
</p>
<p>You can read some of his background and history with the SCCA and racing in the <a href="http://wordpress.tedcahall.com/about-ted-cahall/">about</a>
section of his <a href="http://cahallracing.com/">racing blog</a>.&nbsp;
In 2008, he took his 2006 C6 Z06 Corvette to the 
<a href="http://wordpress.tedcahall.com/2008/08/10/ted-cahall-at-cecil-county-dragway/">
Cecil County Dragway</a> and did a 12.25 second quarter mile at 120MPH.&nbsp; Occasionally he
<a href="http://cahallracing.com/">blogs</a> about his racing excursions.&nbsp;
Some pictures and links of his <a href="/racing/2008/">various
2008 racing excursions</a> can be found <a href="/racing/2008/">here</a>.&nbsp;
