<h1 class="hp">Ted Cahall sets personal best at Road Atlanta</h1>
<div class="hpdate">March 19, 2016</div> - 
With the coaching expertise of <a href="http://atlspeedwerks.com/">Todd Lamb</a>, Ted Cahall 
was able to drop a half second off his previous 
best lap time at Road Atlanta while qualifying on Saturday 
(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLHc1FIH_-8">Saturday video</a>).  
Ted dropped another 8 tenths of a second off his Saturday time
in the Sunday race breaking his best lap time prior to this weekend by 1.3s for a 1:45.07.  Seven of the 20 laps were in the 1:45s with the
remainder aside from the starting lap in the 1:46s.  Clearly a personal best weekend at Road Atlanta.  Many thanks to
East Street Racing/Jim Drago for the motors, Todd Lamb for the coaching and Brian Zellner for the car set up.

While the 2016 schedule includes 
Majors races at tracks such as Road Atlanta, Road America, NJMP, VIR, Watkins Glen, and Summit Point, 
the main attraction again this year will be the National Championship Runoffs held at Mid-Ohio.  
While Ted already attended the NOLA Majors 
(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmbKUb64Ed4">Fast Lap Video</a>) 
in February to kick things off, he does not plan to attend many of the listed Majors after the
Summit Point Majors race.  He is currently unsure if he will attend the Mid-Ohio Majors Championship Runoffs.

<h1 class="hp">Cahall Racing Concludes the 2015 Race Season</h1>
<div class="hpdate">October 4, 2015</div> - 
Ted Cahall raced most of the 2015 season without either brother in attendance aside from the MARRS 8 & 9 double weekend.  
<a href="http://marrspoints.com/bootstrap/points/leaderboard/index.jsp?class=SM&season=2015">Ted finished 6th in the Net and Gross points</a> as he worked on 
his <a href="http://marrspoints.com/">MARRS Points</a> tracking web site.  He also attended Majors at Road Atlanta (two), Road America, and Summit Point.  While he qualified for the Runoffs, he elected not to participate this year.

<div class="hpdate">February 15, 2015</div> - 
Ted Cahall plans to attend another year of exciting SCCA racing in both MARRS regional and Majors (National) events.  While the <a href="/racing/2015/SCCA/">2015 schedule</a> includes races at tracks such as Road Atlanta, Road America, NJMP, VIR, Watkins Glen, and Summit Point, the main attraction this year will be the National Championship Runoffs held down in Daytona, Florida.

<h1 class="hp">Cahall Racing Concludes the 2014 Race Season</h1>
<div class="hpdate">October 5, 2014</div> - 
Ted Cahall raced most of the 2014 season without either brother in attendance.  Bob spent the summer with their close freind, Jim Drake, while he battled a terminal illness.  Larry decided to take the year off aside from attending part of a MARRS race where the engine gave out.

Ted had a number of firsts in 2014.  He obtained the pole position at Summit Point twice and won his first SM class race at VIR in MARRS 2.  He also claimed 2nd place in MARRS 3 at VIR.  He almost broked the Summit Point track record with a 1:26.333 in MARRS 9.  He finished 2nd in the overall points for the MARRS series behind Lee York.  Ted also competed in a number of Majors events and qualified for the National Championship Runoffs but decided not to attend due to cost, distance, and his workload at Digital River. He had his best Road America finish (5th) in the July Majors (not June Sprints) although not his best career Majors finish which came last year with 3rd place in the Summit Point Majors.

<h1 class="hp">Cahall Racing Concludes the 2013 Race Season</h1>
<div class="hpdate">October 30, 2013</div> - 
The 2013 Season for Cahall Racing was action packed with both regional and Majors/Nationals level racing.  Ted finished 5th in the Washington DC Regional MARRS Series and qualified 14th out of 70 drivers for the SCCA National Champiuonship Runoffs.  

On the regional side of things Ted finished 2nd in three races but never brought home a first place SM trophy.  For the Majors series he was able to race at the new F1 track in Austin and finished 3rd and 4th at the Summit Point Majors - his best Majors/Nationals finishes of his racing career.  While Ted was one of the competitors that broke the Road America qualifying track record for the SCCA National Championships, he unfortunately had a bad start and difficulties in the race and finished just out of the top 20.  It was a great year and he is looking foeward to another year of both regional and Majors level racing in 2014!
